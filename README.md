Background

SuperTopia is a classic example of the game Super Mario. The objective of SuperTopia is to progress through levels by defeating enemies.


Functionality & MVPs

  Users will be able to:
    - Move the character left or right and be able to make the character jump
    - Be able to kill the enemies by landing on top of them

  In addition, this project will include:
    - An About describing the background and rules of the game
    - A production README


Technologies, Libraries, APIs

  This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
    - The CANVAS API to render the game board
    - Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
    - npm to manage project dependencies


Implementation Timeline

  NB:

    Friday Afternoon & Weekend: To begin the project, set up environment by getting Webpack up and running. Next, ensure that the canvas appears on the screen and take the time to become familiar with the CANVAS API. Once that's complete, create the game's map, followed by designing the platforms and death pits to be included on the map. Start by designing the player class and enemy class, implementing the necessary code for player movement. 

    Monday: Creating the scrolling background affect giving the illusion that the player is moving. Create platforms and blocks using block collision logic so that the player or the enemy cannot pass the block or platform. Make the logic for when the player loses. Add a timer and hearts so that we can keep track of how long it took the user to finish the game and to keep track how many hearts they have left.

    Tuesday: Create the sprite for the character to give the impression that the player is in motion. Create a menu where the user can select which sprite they want to use.

    Wednesday: Create the user instructions so that the user will be able to know how to play the game. Finish creating the map and the ending of the map. Create the logic for when the player wins. Add in music to the game, so that the user will have a more enjoyable experience.

    Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If there is time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.

    Bonus features

      There are many directions SuperTopia could eventually go. Some anticipated updates are:
        - Be able to have multiple levels
        - Be able to use pipes
