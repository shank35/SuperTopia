Technologies, Libraries, APIs

  This project will be implemented with the following technologies:
    - The CANVAS API to render the game board
    - Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
    - npm to manage project dependencies


Implementation Timeline

  NB:

    Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Setup project, getting webpack up and running. Get canvas to show up on the screen, and spend time getting comfortable with the CANVAS API. Create the map for the game. Create the platforms and death pits on the map.

    Monday:  Create the player class and implement the player movement. Create the sprite for the character so that the character looks like its moving.

    Tuesday: Be able to scroll the background, so that the character appears to be moving. Score, coins, world, time, lives on the map.

    Wednesday: Create the enemies on the map, moving back and forth on a certain area of the map. Create power ups so that the player can get special powers.

    Thursday Morning: Deploy to GitHub pages. If there is time, rewrite this proposal as a production README.
